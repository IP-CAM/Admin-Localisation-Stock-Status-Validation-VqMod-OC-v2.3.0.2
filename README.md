# [VQMOD] Admin > System > Localisation > Stock Status, change the stock_status validation from 32 characters to 50

**Opencart**: v2.3.0.2  
**Attention**: You have to install `[VQMOD]` for **Opencart** ( https://github.com/vqmod/vqmod/releases ) for this to work!

Upload the contents of the `upload` folder.  
You also need to ALTER the field `name` of `oc_stock_status` to `varchar(50)`.
